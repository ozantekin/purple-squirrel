## Local development
A local tunnel is required in local development since QStash requires a publicly available API to send messages to. This tutorial is based on [localtunnel.me](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) but you can use any service of your choice.
<details>
  <summary>Step 1: Create a local tunnel</summary>

  ```bash
  npx localtunnel --port 3000
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 2: Fill environment variables</summary>

  Copy the output URL and fill the following environment variable in `.env.local`

  ```bash
  LOCAL_TUNNEL_URL=<YOUR_URL>
  ```

  Fill the rest of the environment variables in `.env.local` as described in the [Deploy your own](#deploy-your-own) section.

  <summary>Step 3: Install dependencies & run the project</summary>

  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 4: Setup</summary>

  1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/setup` to set up your application.<br/>
